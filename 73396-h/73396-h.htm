<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> superb Bignonia is well characterized by the specific appellation
of grandiflora; and although, in several genera, this title has been
rendered nugatory by the introduction afterwards of still larger
flowering species, yet we think it is not likely to be the case in the
present instance. In Kæmpfer’s Icones there is a tolerably good figure
of this fine plant. It flowers in the autumn, and great hopes are
entertained that it will ultimately prove to be of a hardy character,
when a fair trial of it is made, with its scarcity has hitherto
prevented.</p>

<p>Our figure was made from a plant seven feet high, in the conservatory of
G. Hibbert, esq. where, under the care of Mr. Knight, his botanic
gardener, that valuable collection is in the most luxuriant state of
cultivation.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> Scutellaria is one amongst the number of those new plants brought
from America by Mr. Lyons, very few of which have (we think) proved more
attractive than the present subject. The fine purply blue of its flowers
is of all colours the most difficult for any effort of art to do justice
to. There are seventeen species of this genus enumerated by Willdenow;
and fifteen of them are serrate, one hastate, and the other (which is
called integrifolia) we are inclined to think is intended to
characterize our plant; as, notwithstanding it is called entire-leaved,
it is described as obsoletely serrate, and agrees very well in other
particulars with our species. We have adopted the unoccupied specific
title of serrata, although it is a character common to almost all the
genus, in preference to one that could not, if strictly attended to,
ever lead us to the object. The genera that approach nearest to
Scutellaria are Trichostema on one side, and Prunella on the other; from
which, and many others that surround it, the most essential distinction
is in the singular construction and character of the calyx, which forms
its short but well-marked essential generic character. Our figure was
made from a plant in the open border of the garden of J. Vere, esq.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> plant has been long known in the gardens by the title of Protea
purpurea, but never flowered in this country till last summer, at the
nursery of Mr. Williams of Turnham Green; when, instead of purple
flowers, (as was expected from its specific title,) they proved to be
yellow. It bears so great a resemblance to the P. teretifolia, that when
we figured that species (by comparing it with a dried native specimen,)
we were almost inclined to think a small variety of that plant was the
P. corymbosa altered in its manner of growth in this climate by a
different mode of culture. But comparison with the living plants has now
determined them to be distinct species, and left no doubt remaining of
this being the P. corymbosa figured by Thunberg in his Dissertation on
the genus Protea.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span></p>

a handsome hot-house plant, but from its recent introduction is at
present scarce. We find a small rude figure of it in Burman, under the

favourite genus.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> Jasmine possesses a fragrance of such unequivocal sweetness as
renders it, although an old hot-house plant, one of its best
acquisitions. We have preferred the variety before the species, for its
superior beauty, and the opportunity of displaying the singular
construction of its flowers, which separate into three distinct parts;
the inner one bearing the stamens perfect in appearance, but upon
examination they will be found steril. This, as well as its original,
the single-flowering one, is highly esteemed all over India, cultivated,
and sold in their markets for the purpose of distilling from them a
perfumed water, like that extracted from the rose. The Indian women
macerate the flowers with those of Michelia champacca; the Uvaria
odoratissima, and the common Jasmine, in oil of aloes or oil of benzoin,
and then expose it to the sun for three days, adding fresh flowers every
day. It is then used by the youth of both sexes to anoint their hair
with, which they consider as their greatest ornament. In the spring,
garlands and crowns are made of the plants, and used by the Hindoos in
their sacrifices or religious rites. Both the single and this variety
are figured in Van Rheede’s Hortus Malabaricus, and also by Rumphius in
his Herbarium Amboynense, who describes the flowers as opening in India
at sun-set, continuing all night, and the following, when they fall off:
that the succession is abundant, thriving well on a trellis, like common
Jasmine, and having a charming appearance when impearled with the dew of
the morning.</p>

loosely attached that they easily come off, and, sticking about the
hands, create an unpleasant sensation somewhat resembling the stinging
of a nettle. The fine dark eye of the flower is a great relief to the
surrounding sulphur colour, to the light delicacy of whose appearance it
is so very difficult to do justice; for, in this showy family, elegant
inflorescence is their principal recommendation.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Of</span> this species of Ipomæa there are two good uncoloured figures: one in
Commelin’s Rariorum, tab. 21, under the title of Quamoclit Americana;
the other in the Americana of Plumier, 89, tab. 103, under the
appellation of Convolvulus coccineus; but not to be confounded with the
Ipomæa coccinea (erroneously so called) of the Botanical Magazine, which
is the I. luteola of Jacquin’s Icones, and a very different plant:
although Willdenow in his Species Plantarum has made a mere variety of
it; observing that it differs in no other particular except in colour.
But comparison, either with the living plants or the figures above
alluded to, will prove them to be distinct in their foliage as well as
the colour of their flowers. Neither of them is well discriminated by
its specific title; as the I. luteola is more of a scarlet than of a
yellow colour, and the coccinea is of too deep a red to be with accuracy
denominated scarlet. But references to colour are mostly too equivocal
to be very characteristic.</p>

<p>From Mr. J. Milne, botanic gardener at Fonthill, we received this

occasioned the abbreviation in the filaments, which are generally
extended a little beyond the mouth of the flower, instead of being
confined to the base of the tube, as our figure represents; but in which
we follow nature: and although it is not an unprecedented circumstance
to find the threads shortened or lengthened by culture, yet when that

Allughas grows abundantly in the marshes about Columbo; that the flowers
are very odoriferous, and are made into conserves and used as cordials
to strengthen the head and stomach; from the fruit and seed an oil is
extracted that is much used in medicine. Mr. Roscoe, in the 8th vol. of
the Linnæan Transactions, has ranked it under the genus Alpinia; but the
filamentary system of that gentleman we think infinitely too slender to
support the great difference existing between the fruit of our plant and

applicable to those lighter or darker shades of colour that may
occasionally vary by culture or climate. This Nymphæa is no doubt, like
the N. Lotus, considered as a sacred plant; but probably that species
may be more highly estimated, from the emblematical purity of its fine
white petals. As four or five more figures will include every species of
this fine section of aquatics at present known, we shall not omit any of
them, and intend, in the course of the ensuing summer, to give a figure
of that most magnificent of all the species the N. Nelumbo.</p>

raised in a tub of water placed in a common hot-bed; where,
notwithstanding its circumscribed situation, it flowered for the time in

informs me that this species is capable of great increase from the root,

who knew not whence it was indigenous: but it is supposed to be a native
of South America. It thrives best against the shelter of a south wall in
summer, but in winter requires the protection of the green-house. We
have seen two plants of it in the collection at Holland-house, the
enormous size of whose foliage then indicated an equal magnitude with
our plant when they arrive at a flowering state. At present it is very
scarce, and likely so to continue from the extreme fetidity of the
foliage. Upon burning a piece of the stalk, it displayed such a nitrous
appearance as indicated it to be very strongly impregnated with
saltpetre.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span></p>

the summer before last. We also observed it again last year, very near
unfolding its flowers; but being later in the autumn than usual, most
probably prevented their expansion. We are inclined to think this
species is rather tender, and, like too many of this extensive family,
requires great care and attention to preserve: a circumstance that most
likely prevents their being in that request which their beauty and
versatility would otherwise command.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">No</span> genus of plants more remarkable has yet been discovered than that to
which our present subject belongs, whether we consider their simple
succulent structure, strange diversity of form and habit, or the
geometrical manner of their growth and disposition of their spines. Some
of them, like the <i>Opuntia</i> and <i>Ficus Indica</i>, grow like figs or
cucumbers stuck one upon another; others, like C. curassavicus, resemble
a little cushion stuck full of pins with the points outwards; the C.
Melocactus and mammillaris are like melons covered with prickles: one,
the moniliformis, has globular joints: the C. Tuna, (which Jacquin in
his History of the Plants of America informs us is planted in the Island
of St. Eustatius round their towns as fortifications,) the coccinilifer,
and some others, have compressed ones: in C. Phyllanthus they are
two-edged: we have Cactus triangularis, tetragonus, pentagonus, and the
hexagonus now figured, but which varies occasionally from 6 to 8: we
also have 7-8-9-10-14-and 15-angled species, even their spines are
regularly disposed in quincunxes.</p>

<p>Monsieur Thiery, in his Voyage à Guaxaca informs us that in Mexico he
found whole forests of the Cactus composed of 8 or 10 different species,
from 40 to 50 feet high, and some of them 5 or 6 feet in circumference.
Woe to the unfortunate traveller who is under them in a storm, when
their thorny tops are dashed to the ground! his destruction is
inevitable. In Mexico and Campeachy, not only the fruits but the young
shoots of most of the species of Cacti are eaten: ragouts are also made
of the buds and unopened flowers: even their seeds are made into bread,
and that of the smaller sorts (as C. mammillaris) into tarts; of which
Monsieur Thiery says he had tasted, and they were excellent. With the
fruit of C. Pitahiaha and that of C. Tuna he supported himself when
almost famished in traversing the sandy deserts. Professor Jacquin also
informs us, that the fruits of all the species he found in America were
eaten by the natives. The arts are likewise much indebted to the genus
Cactus, as the cochineal insect (so essential in the formation of our
fine lake and carmine colours) can only be bred upon the coccinilifer
and some other species of Cacti.</p>

<p>Our figure represents a plant that flowered in the hot-house of Major
Leathes at bury St. Edmunds. The living specimen, accompanied with an
accurate miniature representation of the plant, was obligingly
communicated by the Rev. G. R. Leathes, who informs me that it was 17
feet high; that the bend at the top was owing to a want of room in its
ascent, which subverted its otherwise naturally erect posture; that it
began to flower in July, expanding about 5 in the afternoon, and was in
the greatest perfection at midnight: but as the autumn advanced the
flowers opened later and later, till at last in the month of October (by
which time at least 30 had been produced) they did not open till 9 or 10
o’clock in the morning. It is increased by the side shoots, whose
absence adds vigour to the plant, which is as hardy as any of the
species, and may be kept in a green-house, but will not flower without
the assistance of the hot-house, and even then is very rarely to be
found in bloom.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span></p>

describes it as a stately tree eighty feet high; that it perfumes the
woods with its fragrance; that its fruit is of a glittering red, not
falling immediately to the ground, but hanging pendulous by small white
threads about two inches long, in which state it must still be a
beautiful object. It very rarely, if ever, perfects its seed in this
country. Independent of its fine large sweet-scented flowers, it is a
handsome evergreen. There are several variations of it in foliage. It
succeeds well, trained up against a south wall. From a plant so
situated, on the premises of Messrs. Whitley and Brames, our figure was

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> fragrant plant was named by Forster after Commerson, the celebrated
botanist, who accompanied Bougainville in his Voyage round the World,
and explored the coasts of Brazil and Buenos Ayres, the Streights of
Magellan, and the Islands of Otaheite, New Britain, Bouro, Java, and the
Mauritius, for the space of seven years, and returned to France with a
herbarium of above 3000 species, amongst which were many new genera; all
which, together with his manuscripts, are preserved in the Museum of
Natural History at Paris. Duplicates of them were by him sent to
Linnæus, and are now in the possession of Dr. Smith, President of the
Linnæan Society. Our drawing was made from a plant (the only one at
present in the kingdom) in the hot-house of A. B. Lambert, esq. Boyton
House, who informs me that it flowered with him the second year from
seed, in great abundance, and continued in flower all the summer, during
the warmer part of which it was extremely fragrant; which renders it a
valuable addition to our collection of stove plants. The flowers for
several weeks proved abortive, owing to their very singular
construction; in which the short stamina are completely excluded from
the pistillum. As a remedy for this, Mr. Lambert introduced a hive of
bees into the hot-house, which soon produced the desired effect, as in
three or four days after the germens began to swell. The form of the
leaves varies exceedingly, particularly whilst the plant is young,
coming sometimes much broader and with two side lobes; which has been
mistaken by some for a different species. Almost every part of the plant
is villous. Rumphius informs us (in his Herbarium Amboynense) that the
Commersonia grows to a tree in the Moluccas, and is so plentiful that
its wood is in common use as <i>deal</i>; that the bark is manufactured into
matches; and that the bruised leaves smell like the flowers of the
<i>Sampacca</i>, which is considered by the natives as one of the sweetest
flowers in India. It is a native of Amboyna, New Caledonia, and other
Islands in the South Seas.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span></p>

the 11th by the marquis of Blandford from a fine plant in his lordship’s
collection at White Knights, planted against a wall on a south aspect,
about four feet high, and nearly covered with blossoms. Its great
fragrance, more resembling that of the <i>May</i> (Cratægus Oxyacantha) than
any thing else we are acquainted with, makes the plant very desirable to
collectors, and the more so, that it is hardy enough to bear our winters
without the shelter of a green-house, and blossoms so early in spring.
This fragrant shrub is a native of New Holland in the neighbourhood of
Port Jackson, from whence we have seen fine specimens in the collection
of A. B. Lambert, esq. who favoured us with the ripe fruit. Who first
introduced the plant, we have not been able to learn, but have seen it
in several collections.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span></p>

flowered the following summer. It is by no means specious in its
flowers, but very interesting in the singularity of its foliage, whose
uncommon structure is very distinct from any plant we have ever seen.
Mr. Knight, the botanic gardener, informs me that it increases from the
root, but not abundantly, and, like most Cape bulbs, is in a dormant
state during the latter part of autumn, at which time it should be
watered very sparingly. It appears rather impatient of having its roots
often disturbed: once in two or three years is necessary, not only to
renew the earth, but to take off any small bulbs it may have produced.
It delights to grow in a light loamy or peaty soil, and should stand in
an elevated part of the green-house, to enjoy a full circulation of
air.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p class="cheadsml"><i>Cactus coccinellifer</i> is a native of Mexico, where the principal
culture of cochineal is situated, under the torrid zone, where little or
no rain falls during half the year (from the beginning of October to
about the end of March); as rain destroys the insects, and is injurious
to the plants. The dryer the soil is the better they succeed, as their
roots are very impatient of water. Although the insects are found
naturally upon the plant in those climates, the cultivators, we are
informed, always stock their young plantations with insects of their own
rearing, which are larger and finer than the wild sort, and give a more
brilliant colour. These they breed under sheds in the rainy season; and,
when the spring commences, always fresh stock their plantations,
scattering a few breeding insects upon each plant, and in a few days the
surface appears speckled over with them, each bringing about 300 at a
birth. In two months after they begin to collect, by scraping the
insects from the bark with the blunt edge of a knife; nor need they any
other preparation than immersion for half a minute in boiling water,
which is done by dipping them in a kind of sieve, and afterwards drying
them in the sun, or by a common fire. Three collections in this manner
are generally made in six months; fresh breeding insects being always
replaced upon the plants after gathering. Other species of Cacti also
breed the insects; but this is always preferred, as a man can gather
from the <i>coccinellifer</i> ten pounds a day, while from the <i>Tuna</i>,
<i>Opuntia</i>, and other thorny species, he could not gather two ounces. The
plants are generally placed in lines from north to south, that both
sides may have the benefit of the sun; and they consider them fit to
bear insects at the age of 18 months. Although it is neither a new nor a
rare plant, yet as an interesting one, and rarely seen in blossom in
England, we presume it will be acceptable to our readers; nor is there
any tolerable figure of it which we have seen, unless that of Dillenius
in the Hortus Elthamensis, which is not in every body’s hands. Our
drawing was made in July 1808, at the Countess de Vandes' collection at

<p>The plant from which our figure was taken is above twelve feet high, and

the Cossacks burn the twigs of this plant to fumigate those who are
afflicted with obscure diseases, or those which they superstitiously

<p>Throughout this small divided-leaved section of the genus Protea there
is a similarity of appearance in the foliage, that makes the specific
differences appear less distinct than they really are. The
small-flowered species is a compact bushy little shrub, about fourteen
inches high, and nearly the same in width, requiring a light sandy loam,
free access of air, and a little attention to preserve it from the
partial humidity of the atmosphere.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>This species of Origanum was first discovered by Tournefort, who, in his
travels in the Levant, describes it as one of the rarest plants in all
the Archipelago; native of Amorgos, and only to be found in the clefts
or rents of a hideous rock that overhangs the sea. At the bottom of this
rock stands a convent of the Virgin, a large house resembling a chest of
drawers, and to which there is no entrance but by a ladder of a dozen
wooden steps through a small opening in one of the corners, the door of
which is covered with iron plates. This frightful promontory is
naturally perpendicular, and said to exceed in height that of La Sainte
Baume in Provence.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>Vanilla flore albo, fructu breviori corallino, of Plumier’s unpublished
drawings. The botanical history of this plant is curious. It was
published by Plumier in the year 1703, as a third species of Vanilla, as
we have ascertained by a copy of his original drawing in the collection
of A. B. Lambert, esq. but unnoticed by Linnæus or any of his editors.
In the Paradisus Londinensis it has been mistaken for Plumier’s first
species, the Epidendrum Vanilla of Linnæus, (Vanilla aromatica of Swartz
and Willdenow,) of which we have three original figures: Catesby’s, in
his History of Carolina, vol. iii. tab. 7.; Madam Merian’s, and
Plumier’s own drawing published by Burman; all of them totally unlike
it. No two plants can be more specifically distinct, and we have seldom
seen two species of one genus so different in the blossoms.</p>

<p>Vanilla planifolia is an exceedingly ornamental and as yet a scarce
species, and runs to many feet in length, throwing out simple tendrils
from the axils of the leaves. The finest specimen in England, and the
only one that has blossomed, is in the choice collection of the Right
Hon. Charles Greville, at Paddington, from which our drawing was taken.
We are informed that it is a native of the West Indies, and was
introduced to this country by the Marquis of Blandford.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>This fruitful species of Calycanthus has not yet been figured by any

his Flora Caroliniana, under the title of C. fertilis; and afterwards by
Michaux, in his Flora Boreali-Americana, under the appellation of C.
ferax, synonymous appellations equally good: and we see no reason why it
should have been altered from fertilis, if even for the better, unless
that had been a very bad specific title. It is a native of the high

in 1807. Our figure is from a plant in the collection of the Marquis of

</p>


<p>Of this fine Mesembryanthemum we have found no figure nor description.
It is most allied to M. difforme, so well illustrated by Dillenius, and
figured before by Plukenet; but the figure of Miller, <i>tab.</i> 126. <i>fig.</i>
2. quoted for the same plant in the four last editions of the <i>Species
Plantarum</i>, is certainly M. dolabriforme, as the author himself says,
although his editor here has not stuck close to his text. M.
heterophyllum is very distinct from either, is a free growing species,
and flowers from June to September, the blossom open early in the
morning, and shut in the afternoon. It is propagated both by seeds and
parting the roots. The fruit is divided into eight loculaments for the
seed, separated longitudinally by double elastic partitions, which are
reflected above, so that the edges come in contact together and cover
the seeds. Eight elastic valves attached to the margin of the fruit, and
adhering firmly to the part containing the seeds, and to one another
until mature, again enclose these. Two cartilaginous coloured bodies,
jointed near the base, and arising from the outer edge of the
partitions, are prominent upon the interior of each of those valves,
which have their edges always more or less reflected to facilitate the
entrance of moisture to the seeds, above which they continue to lie
close so long as the atmosphere continues dry: but, when it rains, or
water is poured upon them, it enters by the openings between the valves,
and is imbibed by the receptacles of the seeds and cartilaginous
partitions, which presently become much dilated, and the diameter of the
fruit is considerably increased. The upper valves also by this extension
are drawn outwards, and being pressed at the same time by the edges of
the partitions, resting against the elastic rigid bodies on their
interior surface, gradually rise to be perpendicular upon the margin,
when the fruit somewhat resembles a little cup with a Vandyke edge; but
this is of short duration, as the less elastic and hygrometrical
exterior of the valves (for their interior parts imbibe water and dilate
rapidly) soon draws them backwards into the form of a star or
polypetalous flower, with colours as vivid as if really vegetating. The
edges of the partitions now become more erect, leaving the seeds
uncovered; and the water being led towards the centre by channels in the
valves, and retained by an elevated margin, the seeds are floated out of
their cells. The fruit when dry, again contracts as before, and the
experiment may be repeated <i>ad libitum</i>. What a wonderful œconomy of
Nature to produce the seeds just at the moment proper for their
germination, and preventing them until that time from falling on the
parched sands and rocks upon which those plants vegetate! In some
plants, natives of cold regions, where seeds are in danger of perishing
by moisture, and there is seldom sufficient warmth for their vegetation,
an œconomy the direct reverse takes place. The cones of pines, being
most hygrometrical externally, close firmly in moisture, and expand only
in dry heat! The singular qualities of the fruits of Mesembryanthema, we
find first mentioned by Dillenius&mdash;<i>see his Hortus Elthamensis, vol.</i>
ii. <i>p.</i> 237. It has since been noticed by Dr. Sims, who has described
the fruit M. pinnatifidum in the <i>Medical Journal</i> for 1799, and also by
Mr. Konig in the <i>Annals of Botany</i>, but we believe no elucidation of
the phenomenon has been given before. Dr. Hagen, a German, who possessed
the fruits of three species without knowing what they were, imagined
they were the whole plants, and described them as a new and
extraordinary reviviscent genus in Cryptogamia. Others have taken them
for the Rose of Jericho, which is not a fruit, but a plant. The fruits
of most Mesembryanthema exhibit the same metamorphosis, but with great
variety. M. hispidum has the upper valves double, the inner membrane
beautifully transparent. The fruit of this perfectly ripened, if put
into tepid water, will fly open as if with a spring. We have made
experiments with the fruits of M. latum, scalpratum, cordatum, and
pugioniforme, all of which are very fine.</p>

<p>Our figure represents part of a plant in the collection of G. Hibbert,
esq. in the year 1803, and the smaller specimen a branch from the same
plant in 1807. So considerable a latitude of growth is certainly
deserving notice, as, upon a slight examination, they might easily be
mistaken for distinct species. In the first year of its inflorescence
its appearance is uninteresting; but in a year or two afterwards it
displays such an abundance of bloom, that it then becomes a very
ornamental little shrub. It is a Cape species, and requires no
particular treatment more than what is common to the generality of this
extensive family.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>This fine fringed Protea in the foliage is very nearly allied to the P.
speciosa, but the flower is more spread open than any of that section we
have as yet seen. It is naturally so averse to grow upright, that it is
with difficulty prevented from bending downwards, which the branches
always do till they are tied up. In this particular it very much
resembles the P. repens, and, if left at liberty, would no doubt, like
that species, creep or spread itself about on the earth. Our figure was
made from a plant lately in the conservatory of G. H. Hibbert, esq., but
recently consigned to J. Knight, his botanic gardener, who has commenced
nurseryman in the King’s Road, Chelsea, with the whole of that well

<p>Five distinct genera were once included under the generic title of
Mimosa, but separated by Willdenow into 102 Acacias, 58 Ingas, 9
Desmanthuses, 3 Shrankias, and 32 Mimosas. This susceptible species of
Mimosa is an old inhabitant of the stove, and well known to cultivators
by the appellation of the Sensitive Plant (but not to be confounded with
the M. sensitiva, a very different species). Although this Mimosa is
neither new nor rare, it is nevertheless very interesting, and has not
hitherto made its appearance in any modern publication; nor is there any
coloured figure of it extant. Our representation of it, therefore, is in
part a novelty, however old and familiar the plant itself may be.
According to the observations of Linnæus, it opens or expands its
foliage at three in the morning, and closes it about six in the evening.
Its singular quality of shrinking from the touch is supposed to be owing
to its being strongly saturated with oxygen gas, which it disengages
upon the slightest provocation, and its place for a short time is
supplied by the atmospheric air; which retiring, the leaves again resume
their former appearance, and so remain expanded till the evening, unless
disturbed by design or accident; for the rude approach of the common air
disorganises its foliage.</p>

<p>The leaf is mostly composed of four divisions, but sometimes five and
six may be found in plants of a luxuriant growth. Each division is
supplied with numerous little leaflets, in pairs of an oblong form, with
a small yellow gland at their base, which when carefully touched will
close up separately, and leave the surrounding leaflets undisturbed. It
may be considered either as an annual or a biennial, dying after
ripening its seeds. Our drawing was made from fine plants in the
collection of J. Vere, esq.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>This species of Protea well deserves a place in any collection, as, in
addition to its light and graceful appearance, it is possessed of a most
agreeable fragrance. There is a variation of it with white flowers, but
exactly the same in every other particular. It remains a considerable
time in bloom, but not many umbels of flowers are expanded at the same
time. We have seen it in several collections. It is a Cape species, and
appears to be of easy culture.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>The only figure of the Monarda punctata we have seen is an uncoloured
one in Plukenet’s Phytographia. It is a perfectly new species to the
garden, and the only Monarda with yellow flowers at present known. Its
specific title is particularly applicable to its bloom, as all the
species yet enumerated are more or less punctured in the foliage, some
so minutely as scarcely to be perceived without the aid of a magnifier.
It is a native of Virginia in North America, but by whom introduced we
have not been able to learn. Our drawing was made from plants in the
nursery of Messrs. Whitley and Brames, who raised it from seed last
year, 1807; but it did not flower till the latter part of the present
summer. It is a hardy perennial, and certainly a handsome addition to
the genus.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>This curious little species of Melon, although no new introduction to
the English gardens, is but rarely met with, yet well deserves a place
in every curious collection for the beauty and fragrance of its fruit;
which, when cut before quite ripe, will continue fragrant nearly a
fortnight. It is however only to be valued for its odour and beauty, the
flavour being insipid. It is said to have been first introduced by Lord
Petre, who sent the seeds from Morocco to Peter Collinson, F.R.S. It is
also cultivated in Persia, and a figure of the fruit taken there is
given in Gmelin’s Travels, vol. iii. tab. 49. fig. 6. Its Hebrew
appellation of Dudaim seems to have been bestowed by Linnæus, from the
fantastical idea that it was the fruit mentioned in the Bible by the
name of mandrake, with which Jacob’s neglected wife purchased her
husband’s favours for one night of her rival. Another plant with
perennial roots descending 6 or 8 feet into the earth, was taken be his
pupil Hasselquist (sent to the East on purpose to illustrate the natural
history of that country) for the celebrated Dudaim;&mdash;Which is the right
one, let critics in Hebrew decide! The <i>Melo Ægypticus minor</i> of
Tournefort, or Ægyptian Abdelavi, which Linnæus supposed to be the same
as the <i>Melo aurantii figura odoratissimus</i> of Dillenius, and might
partly have occasioned the name, is a very different species. Indeed the
claim of our plant to Ægyptian origin seems doubtful, but we would
reluctantly change a name that has been applied for more than half a
century. Our specimens are from the collection of A. B. Lambert, esq.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span></p>

of it was communicated to us by Mr. Lambert, who raised it from seed
sent to him from Madrid by the late Cavanilles. It is perfectly hardy,
and the roots so durable and spreading that they are not easily
eradicated. It does not however bloom with equal facility, but seems to
want a warmer sun to aid its flowers in their expansion.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>The Lopezia coronata is a hardy little annual, of recent introduction,
and a lively addition to this short genus, which at present contains but
two species besides the one now figured. We have seen them all three in
fine bloom in several collections. Our figure represents a branch from a
plant in the conservatory of the Countess de Vandes, where we observed
the side petals of many of the flowers of a pure white at the ends,
which gave them a very singular and different appearance from plants of
the same description we have seen elsewhere: and Mr. Fordyce the botanic
gardener informs me it was always the character of his plant, after it
had been some time in flower, for the large petals to acquire a white
appearance, as if bleached, previous to their going out of bloom. We
have therefore left one flower in that state in our specimen, to
delineate the variation incidental to the plant from which our figure
was taken.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>This hardy little herbaceous plant was introduced by Mr. Lyons from

know of. Willdenow in his Species Plantarum has enumerated eighty-eight
species of Hypericum; but amongst that number three distinct genera are
certainly included. Our drawing was made from plants in the nursery of
Messrs. Whitley and Brames, who raised them from seed, and with whom
they flowered the second year. Their bloom is but of short duration, but
few flowers are open at one time; and we are inclined to think that they
will expand with more freedom and last longer in a shady situation than
when fully exposed to the solar ray.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 121]</span></p>
